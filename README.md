This is an app that let's you save your clothers in a digital wardrobe where you can save your clothes and 
match them based on the colour,depending on the weather or the occasion,such as fromal meeting or as simple as a day outside, 
so you are always dressed appropriately for any occasion or when you don't know what to wear or how to combine an item you have already,
you can create your custom outfits wihtout needing to actually wear them.
With this app you can declutter your wardrobe and decide which piece to donate or sell.
